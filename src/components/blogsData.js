        // details: "The day began with a trip to Manila, where I explored key historical sites like Rizal Park and Fort Santiago. At Rizal Park, I learned about the execution of Dr. José Rizal, a pivotal moment in Philippine history, and explored the park's memorials and museums. The visit to Fort Santiago, where Rizal was imprisoned before his execution, deepened my understanding of the country's struggles for independence, and the day ended with some leisure time at the Mall of Asia."
        details: "The day started with me going to the airport, where I met up with my classmates who had the same flight as me. Once we arrived at Manila we were greeted by the staff of DJM Travel and Tours. We then went ahead to their dormitories to leave our luggage behind and had lunch. Our first stop was Rizal Park where our tour guide started by highlighting the park’s deep historical significance. Rizal Park is one of the most important landmarks in the Philippines, named after the country’s national hero, Dr. José Rizal.The guide pointed out that this was the very site where Rizal was executed on December 30, 1896, an event that helped ignite the Filipino revolution against Spanish colonization. At the center of the park stands the Rizal Monument, a solemn and iconic structure that marks the exact location of his execution. It’s more than just a statue—it’s a symbol of national pride and freedom. We also learned that the park is home to museums, an open-air auditorium, and even a relief map of the Philippines that you can walk around. It’s a place that blends history, leisure, and education in a way that’s accessible to everyone. Overall, the tour gave me a much deeper appreciation for Rizal Park—not just as a tourist spot, but as a living tribute to the heroism and sacrifice of José Rizal. Our next stop was Intramuros, specifically Fort Santiago. The guide started by telling us that Fort Santiago is one of the oldest and most important historical landmarks in Manila. Built by the Spanish in 1571, it served as a military fortress designed to protect the city from foreign invasions. But more than its stone walls and imposing gates, Fort Santiago holds a somber place in Philippine history.Most notably, this was the prison cell of Dr. José Rizal before his execution in 1896. The guide led us through the very dungeon where Rizal spent his final days. We even saw bronze footprints embedded in the ground, symbolizing the path he walked from his cell to the execution site at Luneta. It was haunting but powerful—a vivid reminder of the sacrifices made for Philippine independence.Aside from its historical significance, the guide also pointed out Fort Santiago's beautiful surroundings: well-kept gardens, a riverfront view, and preserved ruins that show how the fort evolved through Spanish, American, and Japanese occupations. Today, it's a peaceful spot where history blends with nature, making it a favorite for quiet walks and reflection. By the end of the tour, I felt like I hadn’t just visited a tourist destination—I had walked through centuries of stories, resistance, and national pride. The day ended with our class going to the Mall of Asia, our class separated from one another to do our own thing like going to the arcades, food court, and photobooths."

        details: "After breakfast in the dorm, we proceeded to the National Museum of Natural History, where I was impressed by the stunning architecture. Our tour guide did an amazing job bringing the exhibits to life and helping us understand the museum's deeper mission. Right at the start, the guide explained that this museum is part of the National Museum Complex and is dedicated to showcasing the Philippines' rich biodiversity and natural heritage. The building itself is beautiful, with its iconic Tree of Life structure in the atrium a modern centerpiece that symbolizes growth and connection. As we moved through the galleries, the guide walked us through an incredible range of topics, from the country’s unique ecosystems and wildlife to its geological history. One of the most fascinating parts was seeing the skeleton of Lolong, the world’s largest crocodile in captivity, which caught everyone’s attention. We also got to learn about endangered species, coral reefs, forests, and even volcanoes. What stood out was how the guide emphasized the importance of conservation. Every section of the museum wasn’t just about showcasing facts, it was a call to action to protect the Philippines’ rich natural resources. The exhibits were interactive and family-friendly too, making it a great spot for all ages. By the end of the tour, I left with a renewed sense of appreciation for the natural beauty of the Philippines and how much of it is still unknown or under threat. The last location we visited that day was the Museo ni Manuel Quezon. The tour guide began by sharing Quezon’s incredible journey from his early life in Baler, Aurora, to becoming the first President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. The museum is housed inside the Quezon Memorial Shrine, a towering white monument that dominates the park’s skyline. It’s not just a museum, it’s also Quezon’s final resting place, which visitors feel is even more personal and profound. Inside, the museum features a mix of artifacts, photos, documents, and interactive displays. The guide highlighted Quezon’s major accomplishments, especially his role in establishing a national identity and advocating for Filipino self-governance during the American colonial period. We also got to see a replica of his presidential office, his personal belongings, and a timeline of his political life. One of the most powerful parts of the tour was learning about Quezon’s compassion and bold leadership, like when he opened the Philippines to Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust, a little-known but inspiring piece of history that the guide made sure to emphasize. Walking through the museum, I felt like I was stepping into the past, getting to know the man behind the name. It was more than just a history lesson; it was a reminder of what strong, visionary leadership looks like."

        images: [day6, day6a,day6b],
        details: "Our bus travel started from 1 am and it took approximately 5 hours until we got to Baguio City. We first went to the strawberry farm, unfortunately, it wasn’t strawberry season, so picking strawberries with our own hands wouldn’t be the best experience. We just ended up buying souvenirs for our loved ones back in Zamboanga City, like keychains or Baguio City delicacies. The next visit was the Chinese Bell church, the tour guide began by explaining that the Chinese Bell Church is not only a place of worship but also a symbol of the Chinese community’s deep roots in Baguio. Built in the 1960s, the church combines elements of Taoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism, creating a peaceful sanctuary that welcomes people from all walks of life. As we walked through the temple grounds, the guide pointed out the intricate Chinese architecture, the curved roofs, dragon statues, and bright red lanterns. The gardens were beautifully maintained, offering a quiet space for reflection. Inside the temple, we saw altars, incense coils, and religious icons that gave insight into the spiritual practices followed here. What stood out most to me was how the tour guide emphasized harmony and cultural integration. The Chinese Bell Church is a place where faith, tradition, and community blend together, and it stands as a reminder of Baguio’s multicultural history. It wasn’t as grand or crowded as other tourist spots in the city, but that’s what made it special. It offered a quiet, meaningful experience brief escape from the busy streets, where you could just pause, take in the view of the surrounding hills, and breathe. We then settled into our new resting place, which was the Prince Plaza Hotel. After putting down our luggage and eating our lunch, we then headed to the Philippine Military Academy. The PMA's origins trace back to October 25, 1898, with the establishment of the Academia Militar in Malolos, Bulacan, under a decree by General Emilio Aguinaldo. Though short-lived due to the Philippine-American War, this marked the beginning of formal military education in the country. Later, during American colonial rule, an officers' school was established in Intramuros in 1905, eventually relocating to Baguio in 1908. Walking through the academy's grounds, I was struck by the blend of tradition and discipline. The tour guide highlighted notable landmarks, including Melchor Hall, the main academic building, and the PMA Museum, which houses artifacts and exhibits detailing the academy's history and the lives of its cadets. One of the most poignant moments was visiting the memorials dedicated to PMA graduates who sacrificed their lives in service to the nation. These solemn sites serve as a powerful reminder of the commitment and bravery instilled within the academy's walls. Visitors are welcome to explore the PMA, but it's advisable to check ahead for any requirements or restrictions. The academy offers a unique glimpse into the country's military traditions and the rigorous training that shapes its future leaders. We still had a lot of time, so we went to our last destination, which was the Mines View Park. The park's observation deck provides uninterrupted views of Benguet's mountain ranges and valleys. The cool, often foggy climate adds to the park's charm, making it a perfect spot for relaxation and reflection. Beyond the views, Mines View Park is a hub of cultural experiences. Visitors can dress in traditional Igorot attire for photos, ride horses, or pose with friendly Saint Bernard dogs. The vibrant market stalls offer local handicrafts, knitted items, and souvenirs, reflecting the region's rich artisanal heritage. A visit to Mines View Park isn't complete without stopping by nearby attractions like Wright Park, The Mansion, and the Good Shepherd Convent, known for its delectable local treats."

        details: "Before heading back to Manila, we were given free time to do anything we wanted in the morning. My friends and I decided to visit Burnham Park. We saw many stalls selling a lot of different things, ranging from clothes and accessories to food and drinks. There were a lot of recreational activities as well. At the heart of the park lies the Burnham Lagoon, a man-made lake where visitors can rent rowboats or swan-shaped pedal boats, offering a serene escape amidst the city's bustle. We chose to try the 2-seater and 4-seater bikes because there were 7 of us, and we took turns trying the 2-seater and 4-seater bikes. It was really tiring and our legs hurt afterwards. Since that took a lot of time, we just browsed the stalls and what they had to offer. Since we heard that the Dragonfruit drink was popular, we just had to find and try it. We bought more souvenirs like jam and peanut brittle. We had to go back to the hotel so that we could have our lunch and depart back to Manila since we’ll be going back home to Zamboanga City the next day."
